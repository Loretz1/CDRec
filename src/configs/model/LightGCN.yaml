# Overwrite Dataset Setting
only_overlap_users: True # Whether to construct a fully-overlapped (warm-start) or partially-overlapped (cold-start) user set
k_cores: 3 # only work with only_overlap_users, for dual domain k-cores, at least 3 otherwise can not split train/valid/test
shuffle_user_sequence: True  # weather shuffle users' item sequence before split train/valid/test dataset
warm_valid_ratio: 0.1 # Ratio of interactions from warm users in the target domain to be assigned to the validation set
warm_test_ratio: 0.1 # Ratio of interactions from warm users in the target domain to be assigned to the test set
t_cold_valid: 0 # cold user in the target domain valid set
t_cold_test: 0 # cold user in the target domain test set

# 1. Eval Setting
warm_eval: True  # Whether to enable warm user evaluation
cold_start_eval: False # Whether to enable cold start user evaluation

# 2. Multi-stage Training Setting
# (state, epochs, train_batch_size, learner, learning_rate, learning_rate_scheduler, weight_decay) is required for each stage
# clip_grad_norm is optional
